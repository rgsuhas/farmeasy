# Irrigation Area Calculator

## Project Overview
The Irrigation Area Calculator is a web-based tool designed to help agricultural planners and farmers calculate and divide areas for efficient irrigation planning. This project utilizes Google Maps API to allow users to draw polygons representing agricultural land, calculate the total area (accounting for non-irrigable "holes"), and divide the irrigable area into sections for optimal sprinkler coverage.

## Features
- Draw polygons on Google Maps to represent agricultural land
- Calculate total area of drawn polygons
- Account for non-irrigable areas within the main polygon
- Divide the irrigable area into sections for efficient sprinkler coverage
- Visually mark divided sections with different colors

## Technologies Used
